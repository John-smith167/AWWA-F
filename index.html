    <h1>Exploring AWWA Flanges: Standards and Applications</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            AWWA flanges, adhering to the standards set by the American Water Works Association, play a pivotal role in water infrastructure projects. These flanges are specifically designed for use in water supply systems, ensuring reliable connections between pipes, valves, and other components. In this article, we will delve into the characteristics, standards, and applications of AWWA flanges.

        <h2>Characteristics of AWWA Flanges:</h2>

        <h3>Ductile Iron Construction:</h3>
        <p>
            AWWA flanges are commonly made from ductile iron, which is known for its durability, strength, and corrosion resistance. Ductile iron construction ensures the flanges can withstand the demands of water distribution systems and maintain their structural integrity over time.
        </p>

        <h3>Flange Face Options:</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.awwaflange.com/">AWWA Flange</a> come with different flange face options, including flat face and raised face configurations. The choice of flange face depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for a gasket to ensure a tight seal.
        </p>

        <h3>Bolt Hole Patterns:</h3>
        <p>
            AWWA flanges follow standardized bolt hole patterns, facilitating proper alignment and connection of flanged components. This adherence to standardization ensures interchangeability and compatibility across different manufacturers.
        </p>

        <h3>Epoxy Coating:</h3>
        <p>
            To enhance corrosion resistance, AWWA flanges are often coated with epoxy. This coating acts as a protective barrier, preventing the flanges from deteriorating due to exposure to water and external elements.
        </p>

        <h2>AWWA Flange Standards:</h2>

        <h3>AWWA C207:</h3>
        <p>
            AWWA C207 is the standard that specifically covers steel pipe flanges for waterworks service, including materials, dimensions, and tolerances. It provides guidelines for various types of flanges, such as slip-on, blind, and threaded flanges, ensuring consistency in water infrastructure projects.
        </p>

        <h3>AWWA C110:</h3>
        <p>
            AWWA C110 focuses on ductile iron and gray iron fittings for water and other liquids. This standard includes specifications for flanged fittings, which are essential components in water distribution systems.
        </p>

        <h3>AWWA C115:</h3>
        <p>
            AWWA C115 outlines the dimensions of flanged ductile iron pipe with flanges that are integral to the pipe. This standard ensures uniformity in the design and manufacturing of flanged pipes for water conveyance.
